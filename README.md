# openconnect-sso

Wrapper script for OpenConnect supporting Azure AD (SAMLv2) authentication
to Cisco SSL-VPNs

> **Note:** This is a fork of
> [vlaci/openconnect-sso](https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso) hosted at
> <https://github.com/jldowns/openconnect-sso>. It adds support for TLS client
> certificate (CAC / PIV / smart-card) challenges in the embedded QtWebEngine
> browser, which is needed for Azure AD Certificate-Based Authentication
> (CBA). When the IdP requests a client certificate the embedded browser
> automatically picks the smart-card authentication identity (preferring
> certs that carry the Microsoft Smart Card Logon EKU) instead of giving up.

## Installation

### Installing this fork

This fork is not published to PyPI; install it directly from GitHub.
Python **3.12** is recommended -- `lxml` 4.x (a transitive dependency)
does not build on Python 3.13.

With [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):

```shell
uv tool install --python 3.12 \
    "git+https://github.com/jldowns/openconnect-sso.git"
```

With `pipx`:

```shell
pipx install --python python3.12 \
    "git+https://github.com/jldowns/openconnect-sso.git"
```

To upgrade later, re-run the same command with `--reinstall` (`uv`) or
`--force` (`pipx`).

You still need the system `openconnect` binary (and `sudo` on your `PATH`)
at runtime; install it from your platform's package manager (e.g.
`brew install openconnect` on macOS).

### Upstream installation methods

The methods below are the upstream project's instructions and will install
the upstream package, **not this fork's CAC/PIV support**.

### Using pip/pipx

A generic way that works on most 'standard' Linux distributions out of the box.
The following example shows how to install `openconect-sso` along with its
dependencies including Qt:

```shell
$ pip install --user pipx
Successfully installed pipx
$ pipx install "openconnect-sso[full]"
⣾ installing openconnect-sso
  installed package openconnect-sso 0.4.0, Python 3.7.5
  These apps are now globally available
    - openconnect-sso
⚠️  Note: '/home/vlaci/.local/bin' is not on your PATH environment variable.
These apps will not be globally accessible until your PATH is updated. Run
`pipx ensurepath` to automatically add it, or manually modify your PATH in your
shell's config file (i.e. ~/.bashrc).
done! ✨ 🌟 ✨
Successfully installed openconnect-sso
$ pipx ensurepath
Success! Added /home/vlaci/.local/bin to the PATH environment variable.
Consider adding shell completions for pipx. Run 'pipx completions' for
instructions.

You likely need to open a new terminal or re-login for the changes to take
effect. ✨ 🌟 ✨
```

Of course you can also install via `pip` instead of `pipx` if you'd like to
install system-wide or a virtualenv of your choice.

### On Arch Linux

There is an unofficial package available for Arch Linux on
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/openconnect-sso/). You can use your
favorite AUR helper to install it:

``` shell
yay -S openconnect-sso
```

### Using nix

The easiest method to try is by installing directly:

```shell
$ nix-env -i -f https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz
unpacking 'https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz'...
[...]
installing 'openconnect-sso-0.4.0'
these derivations will be built:
  /nix/store/2z47740z1rr2cfqfin5lnq04sq3c5xjg-openconnect-sso-0.4.0.drv
[...]
building '/nix/store/50q496iqf840wi8b95cfmgn07k6y5b59-user-environment.drv'...
created 606 symlinks in user environment
$ openconnect-sso
```

An overlay is also available to use in nix expressions:

``` nix
let
  openconnectOverlay = import "${builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz}/overlay.nix";
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> { overlays = [ openconnectOverlay ]; };
in
  #  pkgs.openconnect-sso is available in this context
```

... or to use in `configuration.nix`:

``` nix
{ config, ... }:

{
  nixpkgs.overlays = [
    (import "${builtins.fetchTarball https://github.com/vlaci/openconnect-sso/archive/master.tar.gz}/overlay.nix")
  ];
}
```

### Windows *(EXPERIMENTAL)*

Install with [pip/pipx](#using-pippipx) and be sure that you have `sudo` and `openconnect`
executable commands in your PATH.

## Usage

If you want to save credentials and get them automatically
injected in the web browser:

```shell
$ openconnect-sso --server vpn.server.com/group --user user@domain.com
Password (user@domain.com):
[info     ] Authenticating to VPN endpoint ...
```

User credentials are automatically saved to the users login keyring (if
available).

If you already have Cisco AnyConnect set-up, then `--server` argument is
optional. Also, the last used `--server` address is saved between sessions so
there is no need to always type in the same arguments:

```shell
$ openconnect-sso
[info     ] Authenticating to VPN endpoint ...
```

Configuration is saved in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/openconnect-sso/config.toml`. On
typical Linux installations it is located under
`$HOME/.config/openconnect-sso/config.toml`

For CISCO-VPN and TOTP the following seems to work by tuning the config.toml
and removing the default "submit"-action to the following:

```
[[auto_fill_rules."https://*"]]
selector = "input[data-report-event=Signin_Submit]"
action = "click"

[[auto_fill_rules."https://*"]]
selector = "input[type=tel]"
fill = "totp"
```

### Adding custom `openconnect` arguments

Sometimes you need to add custom `openconnect` arguments. One situation can be if you get similar error messages:

```shell
Failed to read from SSL socket: The transmitted packet is too large (EMSGSIZE).
Failed to recv DPD request (-5)
```

or:

```shell
Detected MTU of 1370 bytes (was 1406)
```

Generally, you can add `openconnect` arguments after the `--` separator. This is called _"positional arguments"_. The
solution of the previous errors is setting `--base-mtu` e.g.:

```shell
openconnect-sso --server vpn.server.com/group --user user@domain.com -- --base-mtu=1370
#                                                          separator ^^|^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ openconnect args
```

## Development

`openconnect-sso` is developed using [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/). Refer to the
[Quick Start section of the Nix
manual](https://nixos.org/nix/manual/#chap-quick-start) to see how to get it
installed on your machine.

To get dropped into a development environment, just type `nix-shell`:

```shell
$ nix-shell
Sourcing python-catch-conflicts-hook.sh
Sourcing python-remove-bin-bytecode-hook.sh
Sourcing pip-build-hook
Using pipBuildPhase
Sourcing pip-install-hook
Using pipInstallPhase
Sourcing python-imports-check-hook.sh
Using pythonImportsCheckPhase
Run 'make help' for available commands

[nix-shell]$
```

To try an installed version of the package, issue `nix-build`:

```shell
$ nix build
[1 built, 0.0 MiB DL]

$ result/bin/openconnect-sso --help
```

Alternatively you may just [get Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) and
start developing by using the included `Makefile`. Type `make help` to see the
possible make targets.
